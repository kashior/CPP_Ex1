 * This information is stored in three different data structures:
 * 1. vector<RPSPoint> emptyPositions - has inside of it all the empty points on the board at the moment.
 * 2. map<RPSPoint, char> myTools - holds inside pairs of all the points on board that are occupied by the players
 *    tools and the kind of the tool (represented by char {'B', 'F', 'R', 'P', 'S'}).
 * 3. map<RPSPoint, char> opponentTools - holds inside pairs of all the points on board that are occupied by the opponents
 *    tools and the kind of the tool, if known (represented by char {'O' - for unknown kind of tool, 'R', 'P', 'S'}).
